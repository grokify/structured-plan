  "executiveSummary": {
    "problemStatement": "Organizations deploying AI agents face critical governance challenges: no standardized way to cryptographically identify AI agents, no mechanism to verify agent capabilities and security posture before granting access, agents often store API keys and OAuth tokens directly creating security risks, limited visibility into what agents access and on whose behalf, and no centralized management of expensive LLM API usage across agents.",
    "proposedSolution": "The Agent and MCP Control Plane provides centralized governance infrastructure for AI agent and MCP server ecosystems, implementing cryptographic identity via SPIFFE/SPIRE, trust attestation via Know Your Agent (KYA) certification, just-in-time credential injection via a governance proxy, comprehensive audit logging of all agent and MCP server actions, and LLM usage management with model-level policies and cost tracking.",
    "expectedOutcomes": [
      "100% of agents have cryptographically verifiable SPIFFE IDs",
      "Zero API keys stored in agent code or configuration",
      "100% of API calls logged with full identity context",
      "Mean time to revoke access under 1 minute",
      "100% LLM cost attribution to agent and user"
    ],
    "targetAudience": "Organizations deploying AI agents requiring enterprise-grade governance, identity, and security",
    "valueProposition": "End-to-end agent identity, attestation, credential injection, and observability in a unified control plane - addressing a market gap where no existing solution provides this combination"
