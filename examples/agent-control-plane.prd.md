## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Organizations deploying AI agents face critical governance challenges: no standardized way to cryptographically identify AI agents, no mechanism to verify agent capabilities and security posture before granting access, agents often store API keys and OAuth tokens directly creating security risks, limited visibility into what agents access and on whose behalf, and no centralized management of expensive LLM API usage across agents.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

The Agent and MCP Control Plane provides centralized governance infrastructure for AI agent and MCP server ecosystems, implementing cryptographic identity via SPIFFE/SPIRE, trust attestation via Know Your Agent (KYA) certification, just-in-time credential injection via a governance proxy, comprehensive audit logging of all agent and MCP server actions, and LLM usage management with model-level policies and cost tracking.

### 1.3 Expected Outcomes

- 100% of agents have cryptographically verifiable SPIFFE IDs
- Zero API keys stored in agent code or configuration
- 100% of API calls logged with full identity context
- Mean time to revoke access under 1 minute
- 100% LLM cost attribution to agent and user

### 1.4 Target Audience

Organizations deploying AI agents requiring enterprise-grade governance, identity, and security

### 1.5 Value Proposition

End-to-end agent identity, attestation, credential injection, and observability in a unified control plane - addressing a market gap where no existing solution provides this combination

## Technical Architecture

### Overview

The architecture follows the industry-standard separation of control plane and data plane. The Control Plane handles configuration, policy, and identity issuance (SPIRE Server, Policy Store, Credential Vault). The Data Plane handles request processing and policy enforcement (Governance Gateway, SPIRE Agent). This pattern follows Istio, Kubernetes, and Consul architectures.

### Integration Points

| ID | Name | Type | Description | Auth Method |
|----|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| int-1 | OAuth Providers | OAuth 2.0 | User account connection (Google, Salesforce, GitHub, Microsoft 365) | OAuth 2.0 |
| int-2 | LLM Providers | REST API | Proxied LLM access (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI, Azure OpenAI) | API Key |
| int-3 | Tool APIs | REST API | Proxied tool access (Serper, SerpAPI, Firecrawl) | API Key |
| int-4 | SIEM Systems | Webhook/API | Audit log export | API Key/OAuth |
| int-5 | SSO Providers | SAML/OIDC | Admin authentication | SAML/OIDC |

---

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Risk if Invalid |
|----|------------|------------------|
| a-1 | Organizations will adopt SPIFFE/SPIRE as the agent identity standard | Competing standards emerge |
| a-2 | LLM providers will maintain stable APIs | Breaking API changes require proxy updates |
| a-3 | Enterprise customers require compliance certifications | Certification delays impact sales |

### Constraints

| ID | Type | Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|------------|--------|------------|
| c-1 | regulatory | Must comply with GDPR for EU users | Data residency requirements, right to deletion | EU region deployment, PII anonymization |
| c-2 | technical | SPIFFE/SPIRE dependency for identity | Tied to SPIFFE ecosystem evolution | Active SPIFFE community participation |
| c-3 | regulatory | SOC 2 Type II requires 6+ months of evidence | Cannot certify immediately | Start evidence collection early in Phase 1 |

### Dependencies

| ID | Name | Type | Status |
|----|------|------|--------|
| dep-1 | SPIFFE/SPIRE Project | External | Available |
| dep-2 | LLM Provider APIs | External | Available |
| dep-3 | HSM Provider | Vendor | Pending |

---

## Out of Scope

- Agent cognition/reasoning (handled by agent frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen)
- LLM model training or fine-tuning
- End-user facing chatbot UI
- Data labeling or annotation tools
- Agent marketplace/app store (future consideration)

## Risk Assessment

| ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|-------------|--------|------------|--------|
| r-tm-1 | Stolen SVID enabling agent impersonation | low | high | Short SVID TTL (1hr), workload attestation | mitigated |
| r-tm-2 | Compromised agent binary performing unauthorized actions | medium | high | KYA code review, container signing | open |
| r-tm-3 | Delegation scope escalation granting excess permissions | low | medium | Strict scope validation, UI confirmation | mitigated |
| r-tm-5 | Secrets vault breach exposing credentials | low | critical | HSM backing, encryption at rest, access logging | mitigated |
| r-tm-7 | Governance Proxy bypass enabling direct API access | low | high | Network policies, no credentials in agents | mitigated |
| r-tm-8 | Insider admin abuse leading to data exfiltration | low | high | Audit logging, separation of duties, MFA | open |
| r-market-1 | Competing standard emerges for agent identity | medium | high | Active participation in SPIFFE community, extensible architecture | open |
